# EventDesk

EventDesk is a platform for effectively organizing and Hosting events with just a few clicks.
We can hold multiple events simultaneously, with proper Privacy and Security.
The User Interface makes it easy for both the organizers and participants to properly access the website and hence the events are held smoothly. 


To make things better, there is a section for Winner Declaration, where the host can send personalized emails and goodies (if required) to the winners. 
The website also acts as a reminder for upcoming events through its eye catching posters & banners, speaking of which we have developed our own notification system, subscribing to which, the participants will get notified about upcoming events via the email address provided by them. Our support system is fast and reliable, our team will assist you with utmost priority.
It is the simplest gateway to connect Organizers and Participants.
